# Basic Machine Learning
Getting Started With Machine Learning algorithms 
===================================

#### Implementation of machine learning algorithms based on the book 'Machine learning yearning' and comparing my implementation with standard python library implementation scikit learn
#### This repository also contains assignments submitted for 'Machine learning for CMS' course 
## Classification of machine learning
### Supervised learning
* Linear regression
* Polynomial regression
* Logistic regression 
* Mutli-class classification - one vs all algorthim
* Support vector machines
* Regularization of linear and logistic regression to avoid under or over fitting

### Unsupervised learning
* Clustering : K-mean clustering
* Dimensional reduction : Principle component analysis (PCA)

Implementation 
==================

I have also plotted decision boundary and done normalization of feature(feature scaling) and found outlier in my dataset.

The datasets are open-source. I have no rights on them.
